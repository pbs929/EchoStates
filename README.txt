This project is a work in progress.  

The aim is to extend the results of Laje and Buonomano (2013) to show that the
intrinsic dynamics of a recurrent neural network can generate stochastic 
patterns of output that might serve as motor signals for birdsong and other 
variable activity.  

The project uses linear algebra utilities from the Parallel Colt library.
